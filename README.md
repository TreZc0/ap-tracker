# Getting Started AP Tracker

This project is for use with the Multi-world Multi-game randomizer [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg). The app provides a way to organize the locations that contain items within a game via dropdowns to hopefully make larger games easier to manage.

There is a version of this tracker hosted at [https://drawesome4333.github.io/ap-tracker/](https://drawesome4333.github.io/ap-tracker/) for use with most games. The version hosted there cannot connect archipelago servers that do not have secure websockets configured due to web-browser protections. You can get around this by following the instructions in the [Running Locally section](#running-locally).

## App features

### Connect to any Archipelago game and get a checklist organized into dropdowns

- The dropdowns, by default, are generated by looking at the location groups defined by a game's world developer.
- There are other ways to get automatically generated dropdowns for games without location groups as well as to taylor the default dropdowns to your liking. Checkout the [The Custom Tracker guide](./docs/customTrackers.md) to see how.

### Keep track of the importance of locations

- Mark locations as ignored or star them as important so you know if you need to come back later for a check.
- Locations with hints have a flag automatically placed on them.
- A short memo can be saved using the built-in note pad, can be accessed any time from any device logged into that slot.

### See what you have and where you got it

- Easily see where items have come from, and mark any local ones of interest on the checklist. Should be useful for games that treat local items differently.
- Filter the view based on item class (e.g. only progression and useful items), you can view this in the settings.
- Sort your inventory by time received, alphabetically, or the number of items of that type.

### Use the built-in text client to see activity in the multi-world

- The built-in text client works similarly to the one that comes with the Archipelago software.
- You can filter the messages to just the ones you care about.
- This client does not have some of the functionality of the original for commands that start with `/`, but all sever side commands should work fine (commands that start with `!`).

## Running Locally

If you need to run this locally for any reason here is how:

1. Head to the releases page for the tracker [https://github.com/DrAwesome4333/ap-tracker/releases](https://github.com/DrAwesome4333/ap-tracker/releases) and download `ap-tracker-vX.X.X.zip`.

2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a local directory and open it up.

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser. The app should now be ready to go to connect to any AP server, even ones without secure websockets set up.

## Developing

Want to run the code directly and make changes yourself? Here is how:

### What you will need:

- git, [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
- Node js version >=22.13.0, [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)

After downloading and installing these you should have everything you need to build and run the application.

### Installing the app:

1. Create a new folder to install the app in on your computer.

2. Open a command terminal within that folder and run the following command (note that $ represents your terminal and is not a part of the command)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DrAwesome4333/ap-tracker.git
```

3. When git is done, there should now be a folder called `ap-tracker`, run the following command to enter it:

```sh
$ cd ./ap-tracker
```

4. Now we need to install and build archipelago.js. Navigate to the `external/archipelago.js` folder and follow the instructions listed [here](https://github.com/DrAwesome4333/archipelago.js) to build it.

5. Now it is time to install the app's dependencies, run the command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

6. After everything is installed it is time to compile and run the app. Run the command:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

7. The app should start compiling (it may take a minute). When it is finished you should see something saying the development server has started and ready to go. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app.

**Note:** To enable hot reloading you need to comment out the `assetPrefix` portion of the `next.config.js` file. Remember to return it back when creating dedicated build or certain resources, such as images and manifest files, may not be accessible.

# How to contribute to the Archipelago Checklist Tracker

## Found a bug or have a suggestion?

Navigate to [the issues](https://github.com/DrAwesome4333/ap-tracker/issues) section of this repository and search to see if your bug or suggestion already has an entry there, if it does not please create one.

At a minium what you create should include the following:

- A title briefly describing the suggestion or bug
- A summary of the bug/feature
    - If it is a bug, please include the steps to reproduce the issue, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. Please also include which operating system, web browser and app version (visible in settings) you are using.
    - If it is a feature suggestion, please include a description of a use case of the feature and how it would be beneficial.

## Want to add a feature or fix a bug?

Please first find a issue on the [the issues](https://github.com/DrAwesome4333/ap-tracker/issues) section of this repository and let others know you would like work on it (if the feature/bug you want to develop does not have one please create it). Please wait for confirmation before getting too deep into changes, we would hate for work to be done only to be told the feature does not match the vision for the project.

When writing code, please do so in a fork or branch. When the time comes to create a pull request, do so against the `main` branch for now (subject to change if project grows).

In the pull request, please mention the issues this PR relates to (by putting `#<issue number>`) as well as giving a summary of the intent and reasoning behind the pull request. Your code will be reviewed and after all concerns have been resolved, the code will be merged and deployed.

Please review the [coding style](./codingStyle.md) and [accessibility](./accessibility.md) guidelines as well to ensure your code meets expectations. You may also find some of the app [structure documentation](./architecture/overview.md) helpful as well to get an idea of what is going on.

## Have a question about something or need to discuss something?

Feel free to message me on the Archipelago discord server or send me a DM (Discord Tag: dr.awesome4333). Alternatively you can create a post on the [GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/DrAwesome4333/ap-tracker/discussions), though response times may vary.

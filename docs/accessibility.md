# Accessibility

Here are some accessibility goals that pertain to this app and accessibility concerns with in its target user base.

## Color

Color blindness is a common accessibility concern with-in the archipelago community as such we want to ensure the app is friendly and usable to these users.

### Standards

Going forward, default colors selected for the app should try their best to meet the color standards listed on [this accessibility guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/knowledge/colours-and-contrast/).

## Keyboard control

The app should be completely navigable via keyboard only.

## Mobile Support

The app and all of its features should be completely usable on mobile devices.

## Alternative text

While the app does not make use of many images yet, all future images and icons should have alt text applied to them to describe what they are in the event the image does not load or is unclear to a new user.

## Photo sensitivity

The app should do its best to avoid any rapid flashes and smooth out strong color transitions.

## Final notes

The app does not likely meet these standards at this time, but it is a goal that can be worked towards.
